# Transit System Simulation
OOP toy example for CprE 416.

This Java project simulates a simple transportation system with various vehicle types, including cars, taxis, buses, and passengers. The system is intended to demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming principles such as inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, and coupling.

Key Features:

	•	Vehicle Class Hierarchy: A base Vehicle class is extended by specific vehicle types like Car, Taxi, and Bus.
	•	Public Transit Interface: Vehicles that provide public transit services (like Taxi and Bus) implement the PublicTransit interface.
	•	Passenger Class: A Passenger class represents individuals using the transportation system, allowing for passenger assignments.
	•	Polymorphism & Inheritance: The project showcases polymorphism with method overriding and inheritance across different vehicle types.
	•	Coupling Examples: Data coupling and stamp coupling are demonstrated as methods pass data between each other.

This toy project is ideal for showcasing how OOP principles can be used in real-world systems like transportation modeling.
